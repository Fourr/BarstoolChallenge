There are three python files, the first one is RSSGathering.py. This parses the RSS Feeds and stores them for later use.
The second file is the one to hit the Stitch API. This uses the method from RSSGathering in order to collect the data to send to the API.
The third file is one that I created to insert the data into my own local database so I can ensure the answers to the SQL questions are correct.
